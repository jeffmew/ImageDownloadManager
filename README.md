===================
**November 10, 2017**: Hold up! First thanks for looking.  You're a little early, I'll have something up by the end of the long weekend. (Novemeber 13, 2017)  Thanks!




A nice and simple image download manager built on top of Pinterest's [PINRemoteImage](https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage). 

----------


Use Case
-------------

User needs to download an array of images (URLs), but also wants to do something after all the images are downloaded so a completion handler is provided.  Caching is provided so images are downloaded only if necessary.
