Image Download Manager
===================

A fairly nice and simple image download manager built on top of Pinterest's [PINRemoteImage](https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage). 


Use Case
-------------

User needs to download an array of images (URLs), but also wants to do something after all the images are downloaded so a completion handler is provided.  Caching is provided so images are downloaded only if necessary.
